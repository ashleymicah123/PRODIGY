# PROJECT OVERVIEW
In this project, I created a Gender Diversity Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize gender distribution across departments. The goal is to highlight gender diversity within an organization and help identify areas where gender balance can be improved.

The project includes two main visualizations:

1. A Clustered Bar Chart showing gender distribution across different departments.
2. A Pie Chart illustrating the total gender distribution across the company.

# OBJECTIVE
a. To analyze and visualize gender diversity in a business using Power BI.
b. To provide insights into gender distribution at both the department and company-wide levels.

# DATASET 
The dataset used for this project is a Diversity and Inclusion dataset that includes the following columns:

a. Employee ID
b. Gender
c. Department
d. Job Level
e. Performance Rating
f. Promotion Status

Data was loaded into Power BI for analysis, and visualizations were created to answer questions like:

1. What is the total gender distribution in the company?
2. How is gender distributed across departments?
3. Is there any significant gender imbalance in specific departments?

# METHODOLOGY 

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:

a. Loaded the dataset into Power BI.
b. Cleaned the data by checking for missing values and inconsistencies.
c. The data was transformed to provide meaningful insights.

2. Visualizations:

 a. Clustered Bar Chart: This chart shows how male and female employees are distributed across different departments. The gender counts were plotted for each department, 
     making it easier to visualize which departments have gender imbalances.
 b. Pie Chart: A pie chart was created to show the overall gender distribution across the entire company. This provides a quick overview of the male-to-female ratio.

3. Dashboard Creation:

a. Both visualizations were placed on a single Power BI dashboard, making it easy for stakeholders to understand gender diversity at a glance.

# CHALLENGES FACED
1. KPI Not Displaying: One of the challenges faced was creating and displaying the KPI for gender distribution. Despite multiple attempts to create a meaningful measure for 
   male-to-female ratio, the visual did not display correctly. This issue may be related to the way the data was structured or specific to the Power BI version in use.
   
2. Data Cleaning: Initially, I faced difficulties with understanding the dataset structure. Identifying relevant columns for the analysis was a challenge, but after 
   reviewing the data thoroughly, I was able to focus on the most important columns, such as Gender and Department.

3. Learning Curve with Power BI: As a beginner, navigating Power BIâ€™s interface and understanding how to structure visualizations was a bit challenging. However, with time and practice, I became more comfortable with the tool and was able to create effective visualizations.

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
1. Add More Visuals: If time permits, more visualizations like gender performance ratings or promotion statistics could be added to the dashboard to provide a deeper 
   analysis.
2. Advanced KPIs: Creating accurate and meaningful KPIs for gender equality and turnover rates could be another future enhancement.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Power BI: Used for data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.

# HOW TO RUN
1. Download the dataset from ["03 Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx"].
2. Import the dataset into Power BI.
3. Create a Clustered Bar Chart for gender distribution by department.
4. Create a Pie Chart for the overall gender distribution.
5. Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard.

# CONCLUSION 
This project helped me understand how to visualize gender diversity within an organization and the importance of presenting such data clearly. The dashboard provides a useful starting point for discussions around diversity and inclusion and can be extended with more detailed analysis.
